## Link to Project Board

## Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project is to create a prototype for the Chemical Warehouse Control System, and to get familiarized with project management using GitHub Projects using a SCRUM process. We also focus on implementing a user story created by another group to find out if the requirements are described clearly. We will also practice branching.

## Procedure for using the Project Board
We will use the backlog Kanban board to manage our tasks and track progress. 

### Board columns
1. Unnamed: To keep track of our user stories 
2. **To do**: For the issues we have created and that are ready to be worked on
3. **In progress**: Issues that we are actively working on
4. **Done**: Completed issues that are fully implemented and meets the requirements

### Issues
1. **Creating issues**:
   - We will follow this template when creating issues: 
```
Title: Issues #XX: Descriptive title 

Description: A short, useful description

Acceptance criteria: In bullet points with all technical requirements 

User acceptance criteria: In bullet points with all requirements from relevant user story acceptance criteria 
```

2. **Labels**:
   - We will add some relevant labels to each issue

3. **Assigning Issues**:
   - Every issue will get one **assignee** responsible for completing it

4. **Tracking Progress**:
   - We will move issues between columns to represent the taskâ€™s current stage of completion
   - We will add comments to the issues we are working on if anything needs to be changed, clarified, or reviewed
